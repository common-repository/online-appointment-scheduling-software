== Installation ==
You probably know the drill by now, but if not, here's a step by step suggestion.

1. Upload the `Swift Scheduler` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or better yet, use Wordpress' native installer at Plugins >> Add New >> (search Swift Scheduler)
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. To install a webform, login at <a href="https://SwiftCloud.AI?&pr=92" target="_new">https://SwiftCloud.AI</a> (free signup) and click 'new form',
drag and drop fields to create a form, click save, and then remember the number it gives you.
4. Create a page (not post) for your support central, and another to open a support ticket, i.e. 'support' and 'support-request'
5. OR go to appearance >> widgets and drag 'SwiftForm' over into a widget location.

For the various popups, just see the settings area. Note the popup contents get created on <a href="https://SwiftCloud.AI?&pr=92" target="_new">https://SwiftCloud.AI</a>, then embedded via the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. How do I use it?

Easy! Enable the plugin, login to SwiftCalendar.com to get your unique URL, and enter that into the plugin settings.


That's it.
